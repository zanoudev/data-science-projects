# Data Science Assignments - CSI4142 (Winter 2025)

This repository contains all four assignments for CSI4142: Fundamentals of Data Science. Each task was completed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, with datasets sourced from Kaggle or other public repositories. Assignments 1–3 were graded A+. Assignment 4 is currently in progress.

## Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (A+)

This assignment focused on descriptive and exploratory data analysis. Key tasks included:
- Selecting two datasets from different domains
- Performing central tendency and dispersion analysis
- Creating univariate and bivariate visualizations for categorical and numerical features
- Documenting 10 insights per dataset with supporting analysis and reproducible code
- Ensuring diverse analysis techniques: histograms, countplots, scatterplots, etc.

## Assignment 2: Data Cleaning (A+)

This assignment was split into two parts:
### Part 1 – Clean Data Checker
- Programmed a rule-based data validation tool
- Implemented checks for data type, range, format, consistency, uniqueness, presence, length, lookup errors, and both exact and near duplicates

### Part 2 – Imputation
- Simulated missing values under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR assumptions
- Implemented three imputation methods: univariate (e.g. median), bivariate (e.g. regression), and multivariate (e.g. similarity-based)
- Evaluated imputation effectiveness

## Assignment 3: Predictive Analysis (A+)

This assignment was divided into regression and classification studies:
### Regression Study
- Used linear regression to predict numerical targets
- Performed outlier detection and removal using Local Outlier Factor
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features
- Engineered new features through aggregation
- Evaluated performance using cross-validation and final testing

### Classification Study
- Used decision trees to classify categorical outcomes
- Optionally explored binning of numerical attributes
- Applied feature engineering and outlier handling
- Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Assignment 4: Clustering and Recommendations (A+)

This assignment explores unsupervised learning and recommendation systems:
- **Study 1:** Similarity measures across various attributes using methods like Jaccard, Cosine, Euclidean, and a text-based approach
- **Study 2:** Clustering with KMeans and DBSCAN, with parameter variation and visual inspection
- **Study 3:** Content-based recommendation using domain-informed heuristics
- **Study 4:** Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization with precision and recall evaluation
